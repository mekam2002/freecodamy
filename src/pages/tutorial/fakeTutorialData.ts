const text = ` Imagine you're building a house, and this house is like a webpage or an app. Now, this house is made up of different parts, like rooms, doors, windows, and furniture. Each part serves a specific purpose and can be combined to create the whole house.

In React, a component is like one of these parts of the house. It's a small, self-contained piece of code that describes a specific part of the user interface. Just like how you have a separate room for sleeping, a separate room for cooking, and so on, you can create separate components for different parts of your webpage or app.

For instance, think of the "Header" of a webpage. It's like the sign outside the house that tells you what the house is about. In React, you can create a "Header" component that contains all the details about how the header should look and what it should contain.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how components work in React using our house analogy:`
